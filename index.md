# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Scientific Discovery

![Workshop Banner](assets/images/banner.jpg)

## Objective
This workshop will explore the use of alternative representations, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), for scientific and engineering applications, emphasizing the synergy between KAN representation, symbolic regression, and forward/inverse problem solving. We will focus on applications in molecular sciences (materials, proteins, protein-ligand interactions), geometrical representation (e.g., point-cloud prediction), PDE, and world model systems (e.g., reinforcement learning world models).

## Scope
The scope includes theory, algorithms, applications, and tools. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
- **Neural Representations**: Learning with KANs, radial basis expansion, adaptive kernel methods, smooth function approximation.
- **Symbolic and Sparse Regression**: Integration of symbolic priors, sparsity-aware KAN training, differentiable symbolic discovery.
- **Molecular and Materials Applications**: Protein structure-function relationships, protein-protein and protein-ligand modeling, cloud point estimation.
- **Inverse Problems and World Understanding**: Solving ill-posed problems using structured priors, interpretable surrogates for simulation, knowledge-grounded modeling.
- **Comparison with Neural Operators and GNNs**: Benchmarking KANs on PDEs, graph-structured data, and operator learning tasks.
- **Theory, Expressivity, and Robustness**: Generalization of KAT perspectives, KAT complexity control, information bottlenecks in KANs.
